Activity: Tree Hunter 

## Step 1
Use the starter code that has been provided. Make the “runchopper” command. Create a ``||Player:on chat command||`` block and rename it **"runchopper"**.

```template
let flipturn = false
let height = 0
function chop() {
    height = 0
    while (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, SixDirection.Forward)) {
        height += 1
        agent.destroy(SixDirection.Up)
        agent.move(SixDirection.Up, 1)
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        agent.move(SixDirection.Down, 1)
        agent.destroy(SixDirection.Forward)
    }
    agent.collectAll()
}
function follow() {
    agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 1)
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, SixDirection.Forward) == blocks.block(Block.Grass)) {
        agent.destroy(SixDirection.Up)
        agent.move(SixDirection.Up, 1)
    } else if (!(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, SixDirection.Down))) {
        agent.move(SixDirection.Down, 1)
    } else {
 
    }
}
player.onChat("tp", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
})
player.onChat("lt", function () {
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
})
function turn() {
    agent.setAssist(AgentAssist.DetroyObstacles, true)
    if (flipturn) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
        agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 3)
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
    } else {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
        agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 3)
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    }
    flipturn = !(flipturn)
}
```
## Step 2
To determine the size of the area to search, let’s attach a number as a parameter to our "runchopper" command block that will represent the length of one side of the square search area. 

Click the plus sign **(+)** in ``||Player:on chat command "runchopper"||`` to add the **num1** parameter to our block. Use the dropdown to rename **num1** to **area**.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
player.onChat("runchopper", function(area) {

})
```

## Step 3
Create the “search()” function. Let’s create the remaining function that will make up our program. Then at the end we will call all of our functions from ``||Player:on chat command "runchopper"||``. 

Create a new function and name it: **search**.

## Step 4
Add logic to the search() function. The **search()** function, which will have the agent check to see if there are any trees around it. The agent will check to the right, the left, and in front for wood blocks indicating a tree. If it finds a wood block, it will call the *chop()* function to chop the tree down.

## Step 5
Drag an ``||Logic:if then else||`` into ``||Function:function search||``.

In the ``||Logic:if then else||``, click the plus sign **(+)** two times to create two additional ``||Logic:else if||`` clauses.

## Step 6
Look for some wood on the left. Let’s first see if there is a block of wood to the left of the agent.

Drag out a ``||Logic:0 = 0||`` comparison block. Put this comparison into the first conditional slot for the ``||Logic:if||`` statement.

## Step 7
Drag an ``||Agent:agent inspect||`` block into the first slot of the ``||Logic:0 = 0||``.

In ``||Agent:agent inspect||``, use the drop-down menu to select **left** as the direction to inspect.

Drag out a ``||Blocks:block||`` and drop this in the second slot of the ``||Logic:0 = 0||``.

In ``||Blocks:block||``, use the drop-down menu to select an **Oak Wood** block or a type of tree in the area you want to search. 

### ~ tutorialhint
This tests to see if there is Oak Wood and if there is the agent will need to chop it!

``` blocks
function search() {
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, LEFT) == LOG_OAK) {

    } else if (0 == 0) {

    } else if (0 == 0) {

    } else {

    }
}
```

## Step 8
Chop to the left. From ``||Agent:AGENT||``, put an ``||Agent:agent turn||`` into the first branch of the ``||Logic:if then||``.

### ~ tutorialhint
If you do find some wood to the left of the agent, then you will want to turn the agent left and call the *chop()* function to chop down the tree. Finally, you will want the agent to turn back around and face forward again.

## Step 9
Place a ``||Functions:call function chop||`` under the ``||Agent:agent turn||``.

Duplicate the ``||Agent:agent turn||`` and place the copy below ``||Functions:call function chop||``.

In this new ``||Agent:agent turn||``, use the drop-down menu to select **right**. 

### ~ tutorialhint

``` blocks
function search() {
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, LEFT) == LOG_OAK) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
        chop()
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
    } else if (false) {

    } else if (false) {

    } else {

    }
}
function chop()  {

}
```

## Step 10
Look for wood to chop straight ahead. Now, you want check for wood in front of your agent. In this case, you don’t need to turn the agent.

Click on the first condition we made and duplicate it. Snap the duplicate into the condition slot of the second branch of your ``||Logic:if||``.

## Step 11
Now just make a few adjustments. In ``||Agent:agent inspect||`` change the direction to **forward**.

Duplicate ``||Functions:call function chop||`` and place it inside this branch(2nd branch) of the ``||Logic:if||``.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
function search() {
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, LEFT) == LOG_OAK) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
        chop()
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
    } else if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == LOG_OAK) {
        chop()
    } else if (false) {

    } else {

    }
}
function chop() {

}
```

## Step 12
Look for wood to chop on the right. Finally, you should see if there is a block of wood to the right of the agent. 

Click on the first condition we made and duplicate it again. Place this in the third branch of the ``||Logic:else if||``.

### ~ tutorialhint
This is essentially the same as looking to the left but several things will be opposite.


## Step 13
Adjust the direction to **right**.

You will need two ``||Agent:agent turn||`` blocks. Duplicate two and put them inside the third branch.

## Step 14
Duplicate ``||Function:call function chop||`` and place it between the two ``||Agent:agent turn||`` blocks.

Now, just adjust the turns. This time the agent turns right first, chops, and then turns back to the left.

## Step 15
The final else branch of your ``||Logic:if||`` will be left blank.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
function search() {
    if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, LEFT) == LOG_OAK) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
        chop()
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
    } else if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == LOG_OAK) {
        chop()
    } else if (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, RIGHT) == LOG_OAK) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
        chop()
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    } else {

    }
}
function chop() {

}
```

## Step 16
Allow the agent to destroy obstacles in its path. The agent has a block that will give it some extra powers that are useful in this case. The block is called set Assist and it is located in the ``||Agent:AGENT||`` Toolbox drawer.

Drag a ``||Agent:set assist||`` block into ``||Player:on chat command "runchopper"||``. Use the drop-down menu to select **destroy obstacles**.

### ~ tutorialhint
Check out other cool things this block can do by searching for it in the help! It can allow your agent to place blocks automatically when it moves and also place blocks from any slot in its inventory instead of just using the upper left hand inventory slot.


##Step 17
Finally, select ``||Logic:true||``.

## Step 18
Control the agent’s turn direction. You need the agent to turn around at the end of each row. 

Let’s create a Boolean variable to keep track of which direction to turn. We’ll use ``||Logic:true||`` to denote a Right turn and ``||Logic:false||`` to represent a Left turn. After we make our turn, we’ll switch the boolean variable.

The variable **flipturn** was created as part of the starter code at the beginning of this activity. This is meant to be your Boolean variable.

Drag a ``||Variables:set||`` block into ``||Player:on chat command "runchopper"||``. Use the drop-down menu to select **flipturn**

## Step 19
Drag a ``||Logic:false||`` block into the set and replace the **0**.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
let flipturn = false
player.onChat("runchopper", function (area) {
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    flipturn = false;
})
```

## Step 20
We have everything in place. Now we just need to build it out. To move the agent through its search you will: Get the agent to move down one row of the grid, Turn at the end, then Continue going down rows until the square area is complete.

## Step 21
Put *search()* and *follow()* into the chat command. Now that we have all our functions built, let’s bring it all together. For each step, we want our agent to Search for trees, and follow the ground terrain. By searching the agent will be actually searching three rows at a time because it searches left, right, and forward with each step.

## Step 22
Drag a ``||Loops:repeat||`` block into ``||Player:on chat command "runchopper"||``. Place this below ``||variables:the set flipturn||`` block.

## Step 23
Remember, that the **area** parameter is the number of blocks in each row. Drag ``||Variables:area||`` into the ``||Loops:repeat||`` block replacing the default **4**.

Now the agent will search for all the blocks in one row, how ever many the user specifies. Drag the ``||Functions:call function search||``, and the ``||Functions:call function follow||`` blocks into the **repeat loop**.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
let area = 0
let flipturn = false
player.onChat("runchopper", function (area) {
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    flipturn = false
    for (let i = 0; i < area; i++) {
        search()
        follow()
    }
})
function search() {

}
function follow() {

}
```

## Step 24
Add the *turn()* function to turn at the end of a row. Now, at the end of each row, we want to turn our agent around. Drag the ``||Functions:call function turn||`` and place this underneath the ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop.

### ~ tutorialhint
``` blocks
let flipturn = false
player.onChat("runchopper", function (area) {
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    flipturn = false
    for (let i = 0; i < area; i++) {
        search()
        follow()
    }
    turn()
})
function search() {

}
function follow() {

}
function turn() {

}
```

## Step 25
Complete a Square Search Grid. You will need to add one more ``||Loops:LOOP||``, so the agent searches the complete grid and completes the square instead of just searching three rows.

## Step 26
Because the agent is searching three blocks every step, it will not need to loop for the full area given. We would divide the area given by 3. In the example below, the agent is searching a 9x9 grid but as you can see it only needs to walk down the rows 3 times to do so.

With that said, you need a ``||Loops:LOOP||`` to handle this. Drag another ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop out on the workspace. This new ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop should enclose everything below ``||Variables:set flipturn||``.

## Step 27
Drag a ``||Math:0 ÷ 0 ||``block into the ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop replacing the default **4**.

## Step 28
Drag ``||Variables:area||`` into the first slot of the ``||Math:0 ÷ 0||``.

In the ``||Math:area ÷ 0||`` block, type **3** in the second slot. 

To test this out be sure you first teleport your agent to your location using the provided ``||Player:on chat command "tp"||`
